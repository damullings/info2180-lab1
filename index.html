            <h2>Danielle Mullings</h2>
            <p>Danielle is a software engineering student who makes cultural documentaries.             
                She currently serves as the president of the Faculty of Science and Technology Guild Committee, 
                University of the West Indies Mona. Danielle believes strongly in the power of tech and innovation in edifying society and would ultimately like to work in areas with civic applications of technology. 

                Pursuing this course is a result of my direct interest in creating - whether through writing code, designing web pages or shooting films. 
                I also believe that this is a very valuable asset to have as the Caribbean becomes more tech savy.
